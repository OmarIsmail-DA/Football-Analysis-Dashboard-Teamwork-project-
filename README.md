🌱 Analyzing football data to uncover insights on player performance and match statistics, employing DAX for advanced metrics and visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard.🌱

This project, developed at the culmination of my DEPI course, involves a comprehensive analysis of football data ⚽, aimed at uncovering valuable insights into player performance and match statistics 📊. By utilizing SQL Server and PostgreSQL for robust data management, the project allows for efficient querying and manipulation of large datasets 🗄️.

Analytical SQL techniques are employed to extract meaningful patterns and trends 🔍, providing a solid foundation for analysis. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is integrated within Power BI to create advanced metrics and calculated fields 📈, enabling deeper insights into various aspects of the game.

The visualizations produced in Power BI offer an interactive dashboard experience, showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) for players and teams 🥇, match results, and comparative analyses. Users can explore data through dynamic charts and graphs 📉, allowing for an engaging exploration of football analytics.

This project serves as a valuable resource for football enthusiasts, analysts, and coaches looking to make data-driven decisions and enhance their understanding of the game 🎉
